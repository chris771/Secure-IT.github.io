<p> Communication, and time-management skills are a must for this role, as is the ability to learn and generate reports. Being trustworthy and a being able to work in a team is also very important.</p>
<p> I would need to have a Criminology degree or similar and start in a lesser role as opposed to manager. </p>
<p> I find this type of job appealing as I have an eye for detail and I like things to be logical. I would like to be able to assist in stopping crimes before they are committed not after the fact. </p>
