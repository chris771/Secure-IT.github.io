<p> This is group 11. Our team is made up of Chris, Brodie, Jenny, Tony, Chloe and Zhan. Below is some information about our team. </p>

<p> Chris Hole. Student number: s3814641. Webpage: Chris771.github.io/index1.html </p>
<p > I live in the outer east suburbs of Victoria. I have two children, 11 and 9 and two dogs just over a year old. They are a rottwieler and a german shepherd. I worked as a disability carer for 18 years but have now injured myself and am not working. I like to read and really love watching zombie tv shows and movies. </p>
<p > I have always had an interest in IT since year 12, where I completed year 11 and 12 IT while I was still in year 10. I should have really listened to my Dad when he told me to stick with IT when I was 18. Lesson learned!!! 
Computers have always been a big part of my life. We had an old apple mac in our house when I was young and I learned to type on it. The typing game and one other were the only games that were available on the mac so there wasnâ€™t much to choose from. 
I am completing two subjects with RMIT through open universities this year, Introduction to IT and Introduction to Programming. I am hoping to get into a Bachelor of cyber security/Criminology next year.</p>

<p> Jennifer Sanderson - s3818848 </p>
<p>Born in the country town of Tawonga, Victoria,  moved to Melbourne from the age of six until 15 years old, then moved to the Mornington Peninsula where I have lived since.  I was young when I married my Husband and had 4 children by age 27, all with families of their own. My hobbies are Photography and Scrapbooking. I also love travelling around Australia as there are some many beautiful places to go.</p>
<p> 
My interest in IT began when I bought my first personal computer and I learnt what could be created, such as games, different types of programs and software.  I learnt some basics using DOS as
well. In doing this course I hope to increase my knowledge and improve my understanding of using my computer. The advancements made in IT continually amaze me to a point where I wonder, what will be invented next.

<h> Our learning styles and how they work together </h>

<p> My learning styles and personality traits don't come as a surprise to me ; I learn visually, kinesthetically and auditorily. It helps that I can learn from all three as not all teaching is the same and I can pick up most things however they are taught. </p>
<p> My personality was fairly similar in that my openness, conscientiouness, extraversion and agreeableness are all similar in there percentage of my personality. It makes me able to take all things into considerations and be able to see everyones point of view even if it differs from my own, which really helps when working in a team. I can be assertive enough to put forward my ideas but also be able to take on board other ideas. </p>
