<h3> Chris Hole - s3814641 <a href="https://Chris771.github.io/index1.html">github page</a></h3>
<p> I live in the outer east suburbs of Victoria. I have two children, 11 and 9 and two dogs just over a year old. They are a rottwieler and a german shepherd. I worked as a disability carer for 18 years but have now injured myself and am not working. I like to read and really love watching zombie tv shows and movies. 
 I have always had an interest in IT. 
Computers have always been a big part of my life. We had an old apple mac in our house when I was young and I learned to type on it. The typing game and one other were the only games that were available on the mac so there wasn’t much to choose from. 
I completed year 11 and 12 IT while I was still in year 10. I should have really listened to my Dad when he told me to stick with IT when I was 18. Lesson learned!!! 
I am completing two subjects with RMIT through open universities this year, Introduction to IT and Introduction to Programming. I am hoping to get into a Bachelor of cyber security/Criminology next year.

<h3>Jennifer Sanderson - s3818848 </h3>
<p>Born in the country town of Tawonga, Victoria,  moved to Melbourne from the age of six until 15 years old, then moved to the Mornington Peninsula where I have lived since.  I was young when I married my Husband and had 4 children by age 27, all with families of their own. My hobbies are Photography and Scrapbooking. I also love travelling around Australia as there are some many beautiful places to go.
 My interest in IT began when I bought my first personal computer and I learnt what could be created, such as games, different types of programs and software.  I learnt some basics using DOS as well. In doing this course I hope to increase my knowledge and improve my understanding of using my computer. The advancements made in IT continually amaze me to a point where I wonder, what will be invented next.

<h3>Tony Mam - s3816649 <a href="https://endotm.github.io/myProfile2019/">github page</a></h3>
<p>I am 27 years old working as a chef. I am Australian born with Chinese and Cambodian background. I can speak 3 languages, English is spoken with my siblings, Chinese is spoken to my mother and Khmer is spoken to my father though my parents do speak English also. Born and lived in Sydney till I was 15 then moved away to a small regional area on the south coast of NSW called Eden with my oldest Brother.
I enjoy a lot of things in life and do not take things for granted. I believe the only thing I dislike in this world would have to vegemite. Besides that I enjoy sports, games, computers, movies, cartoons, cooking, reading, hiking, snowboarding and many more but Cooking and Computers being the most desired.

 <h3>Zhan Ruan - s3538828 <a href="https://694035968.github.io/Assignment-1/">github page</a></h3>
 <p>Seven years ago, I left my motherland China to start my secondary school life in Singapore. And four years ago, I came to Melbourne to chase my university dream. Years of studying abroad experience makes me more independent, and also teach me how to enjoy life. Traveling is one of my interests. In the past years, I have been to Japan, Korea, Malaysia and so on. Traveling in different countries not only broadened my horizon, but also exposed me to different cultures.</p>
