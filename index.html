 <h2> Team Profile</h2>
<p>  We are group 11 and our team name are Secure-it. Our team is made up of Chris, Brodie, Jenny, Tony, Chloe and Zhan. Below is some information about our team. </p>

<h3> Chris Hole - s3814641 <a href="https://Chris771.github.io/index1.html">github page</a></h3>
<p> I live in the outer east suburbs of Victoria. I have two children, 11 and 9 and two dogs just over a year old. They are a rottwieler and a german shepherd. I worked as a disability carer for 18 years but have now injured myself and am not working. I like to read and really love watching zombie tv shows and movies. 
 I have always had an interest in IT. 
Computers have always been a big part of my life. We had an old apple mac in our house when I was young and I learned to type on it. The typing game and one other were the only games that were available on the mac so there wasn’t much to choose from. 
I completed year 11 and 12 IT while I was still in year 10. I should have really listened to my Dad when he told me to stick with IT when I was 18. Lesson learned!!! 
I am completing two subjects with RMIT through open universities this year, Introduction to IT and Introduction to Programming. I am hoping to get into a Bachelor of cyber security/Criminology next year.
</p>
<h3>Jennifer Sanderson - s3818848 </h3>
<p>Born in the country town of Tawonga, Victoria,  moved to Melbourne from the age of six until 15 years old, then moved to the Mornington Peninsula where I have lived since.  I was young when I married my Husband and had 4 children by age 27, all with families of their own. My hobbies are Photography and Scrapbooking. I also love travelling around Australia as there are some many beautiful places to go.
 My interest in IT began when I bought my first personal computer and I learnt what could be created, such as games, different types of programs and software.  I learnt some basics using DOS as well. In doing this course I hope to increase my knowledge and improve my understanding of using my computer. The advancements made in IT continually amaze me to a point where I wonder, what will be invented next.
</p>

 <h3>Brodie Colvin - s3515209 <a href="https://slurgen.github.io/Boiler-room/">github page</a></h3>
<p> I live in Wagga Wagga NSW Australia. My personal interests are Online gaming, online interactions using streaming utilities as well as upcycling or repurposing old hardware and semi obsolete platforms to increase usability longevity. My experience in IT is mainly online collaboration (multiplayer gaming) I have built many PCs from standard boxes to high end performance gaming machines. 
 I live on a large complex and basically adminitrate a medium netowrk consisting of multiple routers and wifi hotspots. 
</p>

<h3>Tony Mam - s3816649 <a href="https://endotm.github.io/myProfile2019/">github page</a></h3>
<p>I am 27 years old working as a chef. I am Australian born with Chinese and Cambodian background. I can speak 3 languages, English is spoken with my siblings, Chinese is spoken to my mother and Khmer is spoken to my father though my parents do speak English also. Born and lived in Sydney till I was 15 then moved away to a small regional area on the south coast of NSW called Eden with my oldest Brother.
I enjoy a lot of things in life and do not take things for granted. I believe the only thing I dislike in this world would have to vegemite. Besides that I enjoy sports, games, computers, movies, cartoons, cooking, reading, hiking, snowboarding and many more but Cooking and Computers being the most desired.
 </p> 
 
 <h3>Zhan Ruan - s3538828 <a href="https://694035968.github.io/Assignment-1/">github page</a></h3>
 <p>Seven years ago, I left my motherland China to start my secondary school life in Singapore. And four years ago, I came to Melbourne to chase my university dream. Years of studying abroad experience makes me more independent, and also teach me how to enjoy life. Traveling is one of my interests. In the past years, I have been to Japan, Korea, Malaysia and so on. Traveling in different countries not only broadened my horizon, but also exposed me to different cultures.</p>

<h2>Industry Data</h2>
<h3>Idea Job</h3>
 
<h3>Chris Hole</h3>
What does a criminal analyst do?
Crime analysts identify patterns and gather helpful data that can be used to help police command personnel and better allocate their police officers, detectives, and other assets. Crime analysts play a very important role in helping detectives and investigators solve crimes.
 
 <h3>Zhan Ruan</h3>
A Data Analyst. Simply put, a data analyst is to use their IT skills to make reasonable analyses, speculate, prediction and judgment on the given data. As for me, I have always thought that data is a locked box with a lot of secrets in it, and IT skills are one of the keys for the box. When IT is used reasonably to deal with data, I think this process is full of charm. So, I think data analyst is a very meaningful career.
 
 <h3>Tony Mam</h3>
An IT Technician can apply tasks such as repairs, monitor, assisting, and support, maintain equipment etc… Though this role is befitting for my current experience, I do plan trying to reach higher grounds keeping IT manager in mind.
Augmented Reality (AR), the technology that brings digital prospect into the real world dimension.
 
 <h3>Brodie Colvin</h3>
System Administrator Automation
Installing and configuring software, hardware and networks
Monitoring system performance and troubleshooting issues
Ensuring security and efficiency of IT infrastructure
 
 <h3>Jennifer Sanderson</h3>
Jenny is interested in becoming a technical business analyst - Technical business analysts study and redesign computer systems, applications, and processes in order to provide expert analysis on business systems and applications. Technical business analysts study computer hardware and software to identify problems and create new programs. This position reports to a project manager or director and works daytime hours in an office environment. Technical business analysts must have both computer programming skills and business knowledge in order to perform well in this career.

 
 <h2>IT Technologies</h2>
 
 <h3>Cyber security</h3>
 
 <p>What it is?</p>
 
<p>Cyber security is the practice of defending computer systems, mobile devices, servers, electronic systems and data from malicious attacks.
Cisco security blocked seven trillion threats last year or 20 billion threats a day on behalf of their customers and it is believed that the cybersecurity budget for 2021 will be at least $6 trillion.</p>
 
<p>Network security is securing a network from intentional attacks or forms of malware. Application security protects software from threats. Information security protects data, files and information from any threats. Operational security protects the processes and practices behind data assets and the storage of information. Disaster recovery is how a business or person deals with a cyber security incident. End-user education addresses the people factor within cyber security. People can accidentally introduce viruses into computer systems.</p>
 
<p>There are many different ways that a “hacker” can try to gain information about you or your business. Once they have that information they can do whatever they want with it which puts you and your business at risk.</p>
 
<p>Social engineering is a scam that convinces people to provide their personal information to the hacker or other associated person. Between 66% and 84% of all network attacks have some social engineering factor. (Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity for dummies)</p>
A major contributor to this is social networks and how easy these have made sharing your personal information.
 
<p>Phishing is a more in-depth type of social engineering. Emails asking you to renew a subscription, update personal records, one of your accounts needs tending to, e.g.: netflix, has been suspended, delivery notifications and emails saying that there has been a bank error. All of these emails will contain a link they want you to click on or ask you to verify yourself by replying with your personal details.
Even more in-depth is a type of phishing called spear phishing. This type of attacks send emails and social media messages from what looks like, trusted friends or family members.</p>
 
<p>Ransomware is a type of attack revolves around public and private key cryptography. This is the way you send things such as credit card details to pay for something. Messages are encrypted and the public key is the numbers and letters that you give to others so they can send encrypted messages to you. The private key is the string of numbers and/or letters that allows you to read the encrypted messages. Ransomware is when a hacker uses your public key to encrypt a message that has a virus, called a cryptovirus, implanted within it. The virus infects the computer and uses public key cryptography to encrypt all the files on that computer. The hacker will then ask for something to decrypt all the files. Crypto locker is a form of ransomware and hides malware in word macros and the like. It then distributes a word document which tries to the user to open the document using social engineering. After the computer is effected it then spreads to other operating systems. IBM has said that the Locky virus was the worst of the known crypto locker viruses they had seen. It started in 2016 and infected hundreds of thousands of computers and at least 23million email messages were sent by August 2017. (Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity for dummies)
Malware Intrusion has roughly six different types. Small programs infect a computer and then replicate themselves and attempt to send that version onto another computer. Many types of malware intrusion requires a program where it can spread (like a host) but the worm does not. The computer worm is a stand-alone program and can spread on their own. The Trojan is malware that is disguised as legitimate software programs and once downloaded and installed gives access to your computer to another party. The Trojan does not replicate itself like a virus.</p>
<p>Non-malware intrusion is a breach not caused by a program. It uses software that you trust to get into your computer. The Secure Socket Shell uses the administrator’s “back door” and provides remote - level access to the operating system. (Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity for dummies)
Guessing you password is the most common way this can be done. There are tools around to make this easier.  This is also how credential theft can be done. The hacker gains the users password either by a password-guessing tool or by just guessing the password as many people use dog/cat names, birthdays etc for their password. The problem now is that many programs have stricter password policies which means users have to remember passwords that are random so many of us will write them down. This means hackers will be able to physically go to a location or employ someone else to do so, and find the written password.</p>
 
<p> What can be done?</p>
 
<p>There a number of ways we can detect and respond to a cyber attack. One of those ways is called anomaly-based detection. System monitoring programs can alert the user when something is abnormal within the system, it may be a change to the admin privileges. The problem with this sort of detection is that there are a high number of false positives. Everything that is out of the norm gets reported and a user has to investigate which is time-consuming and expensive.</p>
 
<p>Another way is the “honeypot” trap. These traps are designed to lure the intruder away from the important stuff in your system. (Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity for dummies)
“Honeypots” are computer systems on a network that appear to be full of data, but only contain the bait. Users on a network never use the honeypot data so when someone does it triggers an alert.</p>
<p>It is very important to be able to track where the original attack has come from. Fake accounts can do just that, seeding data across their network and having a record of where it was placed. When data containing the fake information is stolen, it will be known where from.</p>
 
<p>Educating users can go be a major factor in protecting against cyber attacks. People who know about password protection and what to look for when reading emails and messages have a greater chance of avoiding being a victim of a cyber attack.
Currently there are a range of different software programs to also assist with cyber attacks and security. To help stop programs like the Secure Socket Shell being able to access your computer you could:</p>
<p>1.        Run your system on a different port - the standard port is 22.</p>
<p>2.        Block the login for the root user - having the system ask for a username as well as the password.</p>
<p>3.        Limit the number of tries that a user can guess before the system is “locked”.</p>
 
<p>Two-factor authentication has started to combat password theft. This authentication uses your password but also asks for another form of ID - like sending a message to your phone with a time-limited code that a user has to enter.
There is now a huge shift into facial and fingerprint recognition, voice printing, skin sensitivity, heart sounds or a combination of them all.</p>

<p>What advancements are there likely to be in the next 3 years?</p>
 
<p>Authentication methods are advancing to try to combat hackers being able to use people’s usernames and passwords to access their information. Fingerprint and face recognition are now being used widely throughout the community with the introduction of the new iPhone.</p>
 
<p>Artificial Intelligence is going to be a major player in the coming years. Firewalls will have in-built machine learning technology which will be able to recognise patterns and code before the computers will be affected, and also be able to stop the threats before they merge to other computers or devices.</p>
 
<p>Experts have also suggested that the natural language of AI will play a big part in cybersecurity tools. According to Sam Bocetta, the AI will scan large portions of data and will learn how cyber attacks will originate and suggest solutions for the user.</p>
 
<p>What technological or other developments make this possible?</p>
 
<p>The beginning of natural language processing was in 1954 when a machine using an IBM mainframe computer was able to translate 60 Russion sentences into English. (Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity for dummies)
Today we have technology like Alexa and google which can identify a user’s language and understand what the user wants to be done. They can also access the internet to find information and do things on the local network like adjusting lights.
Deep learning is a part of machine learning and it allows computers to learn to read unstructured data and form patterns. This technology can be used to teach computers to predict an attack and therefore stop one before it happens.</p>
 
<p>What is the likely impact of the development?</p>
 
<p>Companies that build and maintain AI will need to have a massive amount of resources including memory and computing power. Currently there are limitations in that all the learning revolves around data sets, which take time and money to build into a program.
In the future it is the hope that AI will be able to learn completely on its own and make decisions about attacks and learn from those decisions.
Another impact is that hackers will also be able to use the AI technology to get into a system and use their information. In the same way that an AI will learn to detect an attack, the AI could learn how to hide one.
According to Capgemini research AI lowers the cost to detect and respond to breaches in security. Because AI allows organisations to identify, understand and re-use threat patterns it lowers the time and cost to investigate them.</p>
 
<p>Which people will be most affected?</p>
 
<p>Business would be greatly affected by AI. The way they set up security and how they conduct their online usage will be safer. Business transactions and secure details about a business will be safer and a breach will be easier to detect.</p>


<p>Will this create, replace or make current jobs or technologies redundant?</p>
 
<p>Cyber analysts need to be AI ready and capable of using AI to its full effectiveness.
It will make other job redundant but what the research suggests is that taking the people whose jobs are outdated because of the new technology and re-training or up-skilling them to work with AI.</p>
 
<p>How will this affect me in my daily life? Family and friends? What will be different?</p>
 
<p>For the job that Chris is interested in (crime analyst) this will assist greatly. It will make the detection side of things easier and will leave more time to determine other factors of the data analysis.
As for family and friends; I think it will be harder for anyone to access their information but as far as they are concerned they wouldn’t notice much difference if there is an AI built into their network or computer.</p>
 
 <h3>Block Chain</h3>
<p>Blockchain technology was first outlined in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta, two researchers who wanted to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with. blockchain is a distributed, decentralized, public ledger. The goal of blockchain is to allow digital information to be recorded and distributed, but not edited.
Public and Private keys</p>
<p>When a user initiates his/her first-ever transaction in a blockchain, a unique pair of public key and private key is created. Each of the keys are a long string of alphanumeric characters that help to keep a user’s holdings secure in the blockchain. The private key is known to the user alone and serves as the user’s digital ID. The private key authorises the user to carry out transactions from his or her account. A user’s public key is a shortened version of their private key
blockchain is actually a pretty reliable way of storing data about other types of transactions. In fact, blockchain technology can be used to store data about property exchanges, stops in a supply chain, and even votes for a candidate.</p>
<p>Healthcare Uses</p>
<p>Health care providers can leverage blockchain to securely store their patients’ medical records. When a medical record is generated and signed, it can be written into the blockchain, which provides patients with the proof and confidence that the record cannot be changed. These personal health records could be encoded and stored on the blockchain with a private key, so that they are only accessible by certain individuals, thereby ensuring privacy
Uses in Voting</p>
<p>Voting with blockchain carries the potential to eliminate election fraud and boost voter turnout, as was tested in the November 2018 midterm elections in West Virginia. Each vote would be stored as a block on the blockchain, making them nearly impossible to tamper with. The blockchain protocol would also maintain transparency in the electoral process, reducing the personnel needed to conduct an election and provide officials with instant results.</p>
 
<p>Advantages of Blockchain</p>
<p>For all its complexity, blockchain’s potential as a decentralized form of record-keeping is almost without limit. From greater user privacy      and heightened security to lower processing fees and fewer errors, blockchain technology may very well see applications beyond those outlined above.</p>
<p>Disadvantages of Blockchain</p>
<p>They are horribly inefficient when it comes to power consumption. If only one-thousandth of the current number of miners existed, and thus one-thousandth of the electric power was consumed, then Bitcoin would be just as good as it is now. It would still produce one block per 10 minutes, process the same number of transactions, and operate at exactly the same speed. The energy consumption for blockchain processing (mining, however conceived and delivered) is an issue that doesn’t look likely to disappear.</p>
<p>Future of blockchain</p>
<p>As we prepare to head into the third decade of blockchain, it’s no longer a question of "if" legacy companies will catch on to the technology — it's a question of "when."
In the short term, government-based cryptocurrency will become an area of experimentation and explorations, led mostly by developing nations with unstable economies and weak institutions. Many of such efforts will move in a hasty fashion — with a timeline driven by political concerns rather than economic issues or technical progress.
In the future blockchain era, trillion-dollar firms will be replaced by trillion-dollar tokens — tokens that support a decentralized ecosystem of entities that together fulfill the role of the mega corporation. We are in the dawn of that era, and there will be more trillion-dollar tokens in 10 years than there will be trillion-dollar firms.</p>
 
 <h3>Natural Language Processing ( NLP)</h3>
 
<p>Natural Language Processing is the process in which a computer can understand human language. It is a branch of Artificial Intelligence and deals with the interaction between computer and human. It applies algorithms to identify natural language rules, so that the unstructured language data is put in a way that the computer understands it.</p>
<p>The computer will then extract meaning from the text provided.</p>
<p>Currently we have things like Alexa and Google that recognise the human language and can perform certain tasks based on what someone has told it to do.</p>
<p>Unfortunately because of the nature of human language and how complex it is, it makes it for a computer to learn it completely. Picking up on things like sarcasm and double meanings is a problem for a computer. The language could be there but the intended message gets lost in translation.</p>
<p>Syntactic analysis and Semantic analysis are the techniques used to try to teach a computer natural language.<p>
Syntax is the arrangement of words so that a sentence is grammatically correct.
Semantics is the meaning behind the text. One word or sentence can have different meanings.
 
<p>What is the state of the art of this new technology? And what can be done now?</p>
 
<p>Natural Language Processing can already be used in many ways; it can recognise and predict diseases based on someone’s medical and health records. An IBM inventor developed a cognitive assistant that used NLP to be able to personize your search engine by learning all about the user and then was able to remind them of anything they may have forgotten; eg: the name of a song they were trying to think of.
Google, Yahoo and the like filter your emails with NLP so you are not infiltrated with spam.</p>
<p>Alexa and google are voice driven interfaces using NLP and are able to respond to simple commands from a human user. Eg: finding the weather forecast. And the list goes on.</p>
<p>What is likely to be done soon?
 
<p>According to the Microsoft resource lab in Asia, the next 10 will be the golden era for NLP. The think this for the following reasons :</p>
<p>Big amounts of data will become more easily collected, processed and archived.</p>
<p>NLP technologies will extend into new applications.</p>
<p>Robot and IOT (Internet of things) requirements will include text, speech and vision capabilities.</p>
<p>These trends will stimulate large-scale investment in NLP and attract more work in NLP research and development.</p>
<p>Also the lab says that the areas of next generation focus will be :</p>
<p>Integrating knowledge and common-sense into data-driven learning approaches.</p>
<p>More attention to low-resource NLP tasks.</p>
<p>Contextualized modelling and multi-turn dialogue understanding.</p>
<p>Semantic analysis leading to NLP that is knowledge-based, common sense and explainable.</p>
 
<p>What technology makes this possible?</p>
 
<p>Neural Probabilistic Language Model uses word embedding fed into a sequence encoder to encode contextual information. Unfortunately the draw-back is that there is no sensitivity to the word. The word is the same regardless of the context. Things like ELMo embedding can combat this. ELMo is a type of embedding that gives the words context. It is by far the best embedding model around.</p>
 
<p>Using a typical multi-modal task is aiming to use visual data to enhance NLP. The model takes an example of babies/children learning to talk often know what others are saying before they are able to speak. Babies/children so this by visual stimulation.</p>
 
<p>What is the likely impact?</p>
 
<p>In the future NLP will be able to understand natural language which will make it easy for users to interact with it. Anyone without computer knowledge will have access to all the wonders of the internet just by asking the computer a question.
It will also impact cybersecurity with artificial intelligence being able to understand natural language and easily recognizing when someone is trying to access things that they shouldn’t.</p>
 
<p>How will this affect you?</p>
 
<p>NLP will affect everyone in our being that we all want to get jobs (or already have jobs) in the IT field. We will all need to be skilled in the area of NLP to be “one up” on other job candidates.</p>
<p>I also think that it will make life easier when you can just talk to a machine and it will perform the task you require however I am concerned that this type of technology if easily available, will lead to people being socially inactive and possibly lonely.</p>
 
 <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
<p>There are several different areas to machine learning and it is continually expanding. One area is a scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that is used by computer systems to perform a specific task that relies on patterns and inference and does not use or need explicit instruction.</p>
<p>Algorithms build a mathematical model that is based on sample data known as “training data” so to make predictions or decisions without being programmed to perform the task.  More Data – Better the Model – Higher the Prediction</p>
 
<p>Machine learning can be classified into 3 types of algorithms.</p>
<p>1: Supervised Learning</p>
<p>Is when a computer is provided with labelled inputs with their desired output. For example: A common case  of tagged dogs can be used as input data to classify untagged dogs.</p>                                                                                                                                              
        	 
<p>2:Unsupervised Learning.</p>
  <p>	Is when  there is a massive amount of unlabelled data that is based of patterns and clusters it finds. For example: social media such as facebook, twitter, snapchat and Instagram all have large amounts of unlabelled data.</p>
 
<p>3: Reinforcement Learning:</p>
        	<p> Input is placed into the system model which gives the output according to the algorithm applied if correct we take the output as the final result, if not we give the feed back to the model asking it to predict until it learns.</p>

 
 <h2>Project Idea - Electronic Chip Monitoring </h2>
 <p>Introduction</p>
 <p>The monitoring of criminal offenders has been around for many years. Currently we have three systems in place to monitor criminals. Passive systems where the individual is contacted by phone and must provide a password or use a fingerprint or retinal scan to prove that it is them. Active systems where the individual is required to wear a device that omits a continuous signal and will alert authorities if the wearer is too far from home or breaks the device. Global positioning systems use satellites, ground stations and mobile user devices. This measures the users distance from three different satellites to identify the users location. These systems are good at locating someone at a given time however it doesn't stop the crime they may or may not be about to commit. According to Kelly Richards from the Australian Institute of Criminology many child sex offenders do not seek out their victims and only take the opportunity when it is presented. [1] 
</p>
<p>In a report by the Daily MaiI’s Nic White, in March of this year, it was said that almost half of convicted paedophiles re-offended within four years of their release or conviction. [2] In saying this, many studies have shown that it is a hard thing to measure as many cases are not reported and many of the studies have only been taken on over a short period of time. (Misperceptions about child sex offenders, 2011, Richards) [1] 
</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>The project idea is about being able to monitor criminals after they are released to firstly study their thought processes, the bodies physical changes and their daily activities in the hopes of stopping them re-committing and perhaps stop others before they commit in the first place. </p>
<p>Before they are released from prison, they should all be fitted with this chip so authorities could track their movements. The authorities will then know if they are in a place where they shouldn’t be, and be able to intervene before another crime is committed.
</p>
<p>By monitoring the vital signs and brain waves at the time the offender is in a “no-go zone” we can see how the body and thinking changes and, in the future, be able to distinguish the differences to stop an initial event.
</p>
<p>
Putting the chip somewhere like the back of the neck ensures that they cannot remove it ..... at least by themselves.</p>
<p>The chip will have stored on it the no-go zones for a particular person depending on their crime and have a link to authorities where it can transmit if they go near those zones. By doing this it should stop a crime before it is committed. Authorities will also be able to link up with the chip remotely to see where someone is at any given time. 
The police would have an alert system, whether is was an app for a phone or a separate device that all police cars and police stations had in them. 
</p>

<p>Ethical ramifications</p>
<p>There would some ethical issues with this idea. It is a breach of privacy. The person with the chip couldn’t be able to do anything without the authorities knowing. Is it ok to track someones every move after they have served a jail sentence? and to what extent?</p>
<p>There are also psychological ramifications to being monitored day in and day out. The AIC stated that “ Fox (1987) reported ....... those who have experienced the regime of [electronically] monitored home detention indicate that it is psychologically wearing and more onerous in terms of self-discipline than the world of prison”. [4]</p>
<p>There would be less room for self-improvement as offenders would not have to show constraint and learn to behave themselves.</p>

<p>Tools and Technology</p>
<p>Currently we have microchip technology that can hold a code or set of numbers and/or a password which would then be scanned with a device to access that code. It is used by transmitting data through radio waves. This technology is used in dog and cat identification. The first RFID human implant was in 1998,it could open doors, switch on lights and cause verbal output within a building. Since then these implants have become more technical and can be used for passwords, can contain medical information, bitcoin accounts, and can replace the need for keys by using digital technology.</p>
<p>Advancements have been made within the medical field where implants can now transmit vital information about the body to wirelessly to external equipment so that medical professionals can get a better idea of what’s going on.</p>
<p>Profusa, a company in the US, has been developing a sensor that integrates into human tissue for real-time monitoring of tissue oxygen. (Hacking the brain) Adding to this is a Swiss company called Luciole Medical has developed a biosensor specifically to monitor blood oxygen levels in the brain for intensive care patients. (Biosensors, monitoring our health anywhere, anytime)
</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg is trying to develop external brain sensors that can interface with computers. Elon Musk is going one step further and looking at internal brain chips, trying to merge brain and computer.  (Hacking the Brain)
</p>
<p>A microchip that would have GPS information as to where a person would be allowed to go, times and dates of where they go and be able to monitor all in real-time. The times, dates, location and medical information so as to know what they were feeling and where they were.
</p>
<p> The information would be transmitted constantly using wi-fi to a device much like an i-pad.
</p>
<p>The monitor would be placed in police stations or patrol cars. All the information from the chip could be transmitted in real-time to these monitors. Software in the monitor would then be able to locate, and notify the authorities if the offender is heading anywhere he/she shouldn’t be.
All of the medical information such as blood pressure and heart rate, as well as the brain activity is recorded in the device to be compiled and analysed. The software would also keep a record of the persons activities for court records etc. 
</p>
<p>Skills required</p>
<p>There will need to be many skilled people involved in this project. Medical skills, hardware (microchips) will need to be produced and software for ipads. Technical analysts/crime analysts for compiling data. A system administrator for maintenance and troubleshooting, an IT Technologist for maintaining equipment, other medical professionals for seeing the mental health aspects and how an offenders thinking could be changed earlier on in life.

<p>Outcomes and advantages</p>
<p>If this project is successful the problem of sex offenders will not be solved but the re- occurrence will be diminished and our children will be a lot safer. If this project is successful there is no reason it could not be used for other offenders to diminish crimes occurring. 
With enough information on how the brain works during certain circumstances, and being able to see commonalities between offenders we mean would be able to see the issues earlier in life and hopefully be able to stop offences before they are committed. 
The advantages are that the general population would be safer, there would be a monitoring system not leaving the police to just guess where a person is at a particular time and less offences committed being that there will be a lack of opportunity. 
We would also be able to learn what triggers effect offenders and how their body changes, including brain activity. If we can understand the reasons we may be able to change how an offender thinks and therefore change the behaviour.

<h2>IT Work</h2>

<p>The most interesting part of this interview we all agreed on was that there wasnt alot of time spent on computers!</p>
 <h2>Group Reflection</h2>
 <p>All in all the whole group agrees that this assignment was a lot harder than it sounded. We spent a lot of time finding a common place to collaborate as a team and are still coming to grips with the various avenues in which we communicate and express ideas.
What one person would consider a one stop channel to communicate, others found unfamiliar and abit too much. Which meant we all had to adjust to accommodate every group member. We     have partially settled on “Discord” for discussions about the assignment criteria, but found “Google Documents” as a way to put our work to paper so to speak. With our group being quiet varied in our familiarity of the technology we were using there was a need for patience and understanding to all members of the group.</p>
<p>Our group worked fairly well together when we all managed to get together. Discussion were placed on discord and google docs was where we had all our documents. 
I was quite impressed with the work that was put in by some of the members in a short space of time as we had had trouble all being around at the same time.
The members of our team that did participate were also assisting each other with references, youtube videos and information. There was good feedback when someone had done well. Negative feedback was given really well in that nobody said how bad they thought some parts were but that it needed attention and gave suggestions about how it could be changed.</p>
<p>Our group were formed to complete the assignment ‘IT-Team Project’. The assignment is to use individual’s profile and project idea in assignment 1 and then to produce a report on various aspects of the IT industry. We were confused at the beginning and we were not able to discuss it face to face. The first challenge faced after group formation was how to organise the work to complete the task on time. At first stage we divided the task in to smaller pieces and assign these parts to each team member. Each of us work together to complete research tasks and shared information with each other. At the end of the project, what matters the most is what we have learned from our group work experiences. During the tenure of working together, situations cropped up and tested us on the scales of making the decisions and handling the pressures and exceptions.</p>
